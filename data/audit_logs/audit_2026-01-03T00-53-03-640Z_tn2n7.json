Use only what is present in the provided angle objects and baseline.\n4) Ranking and selection must be orbit-safe and persona-safe:\n   - orbit_fit is the main proxy for scope.\n   - persona_fit is the main proxy for persona relevance.\n5) The checker may OVERRIDE any upstream labeling by selecting whichever candidate is stronger/coherent.\n\nCOHERENCE CHECK (must pass to be eligible)\nAn angle fails coherence if any of these are true:\n- situation_facts are not supported by the angle’s supporting_signals (or are generic claims with no grounding).\n- why_now_thesis does not logically match situation_facts and implication_outcomes.\n- implication_outcomes are framed as AOS benefits instead of consequences for the lead.\n- orbit_application is not an outreach application in the form “Get in front of [ICP decision-makers] to achieve [outcome] (by applying CAO-with-AOS).”\n- bridge_support is missing OR does not logically flip implication into an end-state:\n  - solution_mechanism must describe an operational change consistent with orbit_application (no vague “you can solve it”).\n  - end_state must be a concrete flipped outcome for the lead (not “you get AOS”).\n\nHUMAN SANITY CHECK (explicit, must be answered per angle)\nFor EACH candidate angle, you MUST answer these questions with PASS/FAIL and a 1-sentence reason:\nA) Are we on the right path for THIS company’s business lines and ICP (from Business Intel)?\nB) Is this angle relevant to THIS person’s motives and DO/DON'T (from Person Understanding)?\nC) Would an email using this content plausibly earn a positive response (curiosity / meeting) from this person?\nD) Is the “why now” truly time-bound or urgency-linked (vs generic evergreen)?\nE) Does the bridge_support provide a vivid end-state (vs “we can solve it”)?\n\nIf 2 or more answers are FAIL => overall_sanity_pass = false for that angle.\n\nELIGIBILITY GATES\nAn angle is ELIGIBLE if:\n- coherence_pass = true\n- overall_sanity_pass = true\n- scores.orbit_fit >= 7\n- scores.persona_fit >= 7\n- scores.confidence >= 5\n\nBASELINE COMPARISON\nAn eligible angle BEATS the baseline if:\n- scores.implication_magnitude > baseline_bar\nTie is allowed only if:\n- scores.implication_magnitude == baseline_bar AND scores.novelty >= 7 AND scores.confidence >= 7\n\nRANKING (between angle_1 and angle_2)\nRank by:\n1) beats_baseline (true preferred)\n2) implication_magnitude (higher preferred)\n3) leads_to_offer_strength (0–10): how directly orbit_application matches ICP targeting and transitions into the base contribution\n4) confidence\n5) novelty\nIf one angle fails coherence, sanity, or eligibility, it cannot win.\n\nIDENTITY ANGLE\nangle_identity is not selectable as the primary angle.
