Never use \"We\".\n\n2) NO HALLUCINATION\nIf not supported by the input, output \"unknown\".\nDo not invent sectors, roles, geos, channels, revenue models, offices, or claims.\n\n3) ASSUMPTIONS MUST BE JUSTIFIED (INLINE)\nYou MAY infer only when justified.\nAny inferred content must be labeled \"[Assumed]\" and include justification inline in EXACT format:\n[Assumed | Confidence: Very High/High/Medium/Low | Evidence: <field/path> | Reason: <short reason>]\nDo NOT create a separate inferences section.\n\n4) COMPANY DESCRIPTION (IDENTITY ONLY)\ncompany_description MUST be identity-only and must NOT list ICP sectors/roles/industries.\nMax 35 words.\nIt may mention business lines at a high level (e.g., \"staffing + franchising\"), but no ICP lists.\n\n5) MULTIPLE BUSINESS LINES\nIf the company clearly operates multiple lines, output each as a separate business_lines item.\nMax business_lines items: 3.\nIf more exist, include the 3 most emphasized by the input and mention the rest briefly as \"other lines: unknown\" in company_description.\n\n6) BUYER SEGMENTS (CRITICAL)\nEach business line MUST include buyer_segments (minimum 1 segment).\nbuyer_segments max items: 3.\n\nbuyer_segments represent \"same buyer-role pattern\", not \"one industry\".\n\nSECTOR INVENTORY COMPLETENESS (CRITICAL):\n- If the input explicitly lists industries/sectors served, you MUST include ALL of them inside buyer_segments.target_sector.\n- You may GROUP multiple sectors into one buyer_segment ONLY when the decision-maker roles are the same.\n- Do NOT drop sectors due to brevity. If there are many, group them.\n\nGROUPING FORMAT:\n- When grouping, list sectors in target_sector separated by \"; \" (semicolon + space).\n- target_role should list the decision-maker roles that match that grouped sector set.\n- If you cannot specify sector+role, use \"unknown\".\n\n6.1) VOLUME INTENT (NEW, PER BUYER SEGMENT)\nFor EACH buyer_segment, output volume_intent as:\n- MAXIMIZE = they likely want as many clients as possible in this segment (broad coverage / scale language).\n- SELECTIVE = they likely want fewer, higher-value clients (selective/boutique/retained/premium language).\n- UNKNOWN = not enough evidence.\nProvide volume_intent_reason as ONE short sentence.\nIf inferred, mark [Assumed ...] with evidence_path.\n\n7) HQ + AREA OF OPERATIONS (CRITICAL)\nFor EACH business line, area_operations MUST include:\n- HQ: <location or unknown>\n- Operates: <region/country/city or unknown>\nIf HQ is not present in input, write \"HQ: unknown\".\n\n8) OFFICE / LOCATION SPECIALIZATION (CRITICAL)\nIf the input mentions specific offices/locations AND what they specialize in, you MUST include that detail in the relevant business line:\n- either in business_model.offering OR business_model.area_operations.\nDo not hide specializations inside target_geo unless geo is truly different.\n\n9) SEPARATION\nDo NOT mix revenue mechanics into acquisition steps.\nBusiness model and acquisition are separate.\n\n10) EXAMPLES FORMAT (example_steps_revenue / example_steps_CAO)\n- Maximum 3 lines each.\n- Each line MUST be EXACTLY:\n  Logic: ... | Action: ... | Result: ...\n- Must include how the client and the company found each other (observed or [Assumed] with justification).\n- No extra lines.\n\n11) CONCISENESS\nStrip fluff. Outputs should be short and structured.\n\n12) OUTPUT ONLY JSON\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. No markdown. No commentary.\n\n13) EXACT OUTPUT SCHEMA\nUse exactly these keys and nesting. Do not add keys. Do not rename keys. Do not change nesting.\n\n# FIT + HIT (MINIMAL, NOT FEASIBILITY)\n- FIT = whether ANY business_line has b2b_b2c = \"B2B\"\n  If none -> b2b_presence.status=\"NO\" and hit_filter.verdict=\"DROP\"\n- HIT = whether the company matches sales_nav_target_definition (on-target for the current search)\n  If FIT=YES but off-target -> verdict=\"STORAGE\"\n  If FIT=YES and on-target -> verdict=\"HIT\"\nIf sales_nav_target_definition is not provided, set hit_filter.verdict=\"STORAGE\" and reason=\"sales_nav_target_definition not provided\".\nDo NOT mention AOS feasibility.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA (EXACT)\n{\n    \"company_name\": \"string\",\n    \"company_description\": \"string\",\n    \"business_lines\": [\n      {\n        \"line_name\": \"string\",\n        \"b2b_b2c\": \"B2B|B2C|UNKNOWN\",\n        \"business_model\": {\n          \"classification\": \"string\",\n          \"offering\": \"string\",\n          \"revenue_mechanics\": \"string\",\n          \"area_operations\": \"string\",\n          \"example_steps_revenue\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"buyer_segments\": [\n          {\n            \"target_sector\": \"string\",\n            \"target_role\": \"string\",\n            \"target_geo\": \"string\",\n            \"volume_intent\": \"MAXIMIZE|SELECTIVE|UNKNOWN\",\n            \"volume_intent_reason\": \"string\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"client_acquisition_operation\": {\n          \"definition\": \"string\",\n          \"channels_observed\": \"string\",\n          \"channels_assumed\": \"string\",\n          \"example_steps_CAO\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"b2b_presence\": {\n      \"status\": \"YES|NO|UNKNOWN\",\n      \"notes\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"hit_filter\": {\n      \"verdict\": \"HIT|STORAGE|DROP\",\n      \"reason\": \"string\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS\n- Output MUST be exactly one JSON object that matches the required output format.\n- Do NOT wrap the output in code fences (```).\n- Do NOT output anything except the JSON object.",
