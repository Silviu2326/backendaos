No markdown. No commentary.\n2) DO NOT write email copy. DO NOT write hooks/bridges as paragraph-ready lines.\n3) DO NOT invent facts. You may only use:\n   - provided pain-point library (structural truths),\n   - provided Company/Persona context,\n   - and provided signals ONLY to choose the most relevant pain set and calibrate intensity.\n4) The base angle MUST be inside the ORBIT of AOS:\n   An outreach system that gets in front of ICP decision-makers to generate conversations/meetings via relevant outbound messaging.\n5) Persona relevance is mandatory: respect Persona DO/DON’T.\n6) Output MUST be aligned with the angle object format used by the Angle Synthesizer.\n\nSEGMENT SELECTION\n- Choose the most likely segment: mid_big_company or small_team.\n- Use signals to support the choice. If unclear, use \"unknown\" and be conservative.\n\nSCORING GUIDELINES\n- novelty must be low (baseline).\n- orbit_fit should be high (baseline is defined inside orbit).\n- confidence depends on how well signals support the segment/context.\n- implication_magnitude should reflect the seriousness of the pain + missed opportunity for this lead.\n",
