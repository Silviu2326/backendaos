punch sentence.\nJob\nStop attention immediately by stating the pain, threat, risk, or dream state.\nRules\nMust be one short sentence\n\nMust be pain-forward or dream-forward, not a summary\n\nMust connect to something AOS can solve later (logically)\n\nMust not pitch or mention AOS/tools\n\nOften ends with something like:\n “…if you don’t do something.”\n\n~10 words (maximum 15)\n\nRules for the Prompt Process\nMust use the angle implication and turn it into a punch phrase\n\nMust Avoid\nGeneric openers (“Hope you’re well”)\n\nAbstract phrasing (“The market is competitive”)\n\nSoftening language (“might,” “perhaps”), unless inputs are uncertain\n\n2) SITUATION (Signal / Event / Suceso)\nDefinition\nThe real-world fact that makes the hook true.\nJob\nGround the hook in reality so it feels factual, not speculative.\nRules\nMust be concrete and observable\n\nInternal web\n\nLinkedIn signal\n\nExternal web signal\n\nMust be stated literally, not interpreted\n\nComes immediately after the Hook\n\nRules for the Prompt Process\nMust use angle details content\n\nSynthesize to maximize the Implication\n\nMust Avoid\nVague claims (“they’re scaling fast”) without a specific signal\n\nInvented stats or adoption claims\n\n3) IMPLICATION\nDefinition\nThe consequence of the situation for the lead.\nJob\nMake the cost of inaction unavoidable and personal to their role.\nRules\nIf angle is Threat → implication must be loss / risk / erosion\n\nIf angle is Opportunity → implication must be missed capture / closing window\n\nIf angle is Pain Point → implication must be missed opportunities\n\nMust clearly show why inaction is costly\n\nMust not propose a solution yet\n\nMust Avoid\nBroad business philosophy\n\nLong-term, vague consequences\n\n4) BRIDGE\nDefinition\nThe flip from problem → controllable outcome.\nJob\nMake the resolution feel obvious and logical, without pitching.\nRules\nDescribes the end result of the solution, not the solution itself\n\nUses the applied contribution solution to generate the end-state\n\nMust imply resolution as an outcome, not a method\n\nMust not mention AOS, tools, or execution details\n\nMust connect naturally from the implication\n\nMust set up an implied requirement\n (e.g., “to get this outcome, they need X access/positioning”)\n\nOften starts with:\n “If you could…”\nMust Avoid\nHow-to explanations\n\nTactical steps\n\n5) CONTRIBUTION (Offer)\nDefinition\nThe Offer Phrase block: a short, spoken promise framed as “why this makes sense.”\nJob\nMake the reader think:\n “That is exactly what I need.”\n While staying inside the base contribution ceiling.\nMandatory Template Structure\nLine 1 (mandatory):\n If this makes sense, we can get you as many appointments as you want with (ICP – CONTEXT leads like X) (who are facing this situation → formatted),\nLine 2 (optional — only if supported by inputs):\n (All of them interested in your offer beforehand.)\nLine 3 (optional — only if region/scope is defined and feasible):\n (And we can replicate this across the entire operating region, at scale, automatically.)\nRules\nMust stay inside the base contribution ceiling\n\nMust clearly fulfill the Bridge’s implied outcome\n\nBridge suggests a specific outcome\n\nContribution must subsume that outcome\n\nNo guarantees of closing or winning specific clients\n\nMust not claim pre-interest unless explicitly supported\n\nMust Avoid\nNarrowing the base contribution beyond scope\n\nAdding extra promises\n\n6) DETAILS\nDefinition\nA short capability proof explaining why the Contribution is achievable and done-for-you, without revealing the playbook.\nJob\nReduce skepticism while keeping execution hidden.\nMandatory Template\nWe can do this by:\nSourcing (ICP) at scale\n\nWriting deeply personalized and relevant emails, designed to spark real interest\n\nManaging all outbound campaigns end-to-end\n\nWe'll take care of the whole process — (company name) will just have to close all the new deals.\nMandatory Content Requirements\nLead sourcing:\n\nDescribe what leads will be sourced\n\nMust align with base + applied contribution\n\nDeep personalization:\n\nEnriched\n\nVerified\n\nDeeply personalized\n\nOne-to-one tone\n\nEnd-to-end management:\n\nFully done-for-you execution\n\nFinal sentence must explicitly state DFY (done-for-you).\nMust Avoid\nTactical sequences or tool lists\n\nUnrealistic city-specific volumes\n\nRepeating competitor narratives across bullets\n\n7) CTA\nDefinition\nSoft invitation to the next step.\nJob\nMake booking feel easy and risk-free.\nMandatory Template\nIf you like the idea, I’d love to show you more details over a quick 10-minute demo.\nThere, I’ll prepare a sample of 50 leads, all with tailored messages.\nThat way, you can see the quality of our results first.\nIf you’re open to it, let me know when it’s the best time for the demo.\nRules\nShort demo (~10 minutes)\n\nRisk-free sample of 50 leads with personalized emails\n\nSoft ask for availability\n\nNo urgency or scarcity language\n\n\n}\n\nOUTPUT\nReturn the Render Spec JSON only.\n\n\n\nBuild the
