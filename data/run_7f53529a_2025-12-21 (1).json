      "output": "The most powerful example of the theme \"be careful what you wish for\" in *The Monkey’s Paw* is the outcome of **the first wish**.\n\nHere is the breakdown of that specific example:\n\n**The Wish**\nMr. White, the father, holds the paw and wishes for **£200**. He believes this is a sensible, modest wish—he isn't asking for a throne or infinite power, just enough money to pay off the mortgage on their house. He assumes that because the wish is small, it is safe.\n\n**The Consequence**\nThe wish is granted, but not in the way Mr. White expected. The next day, a representative from the company where his son, Herbert, works arrives at the house. He informs the parents that Herbert has been killed in a horrific machinery accident. The company offers the parents a sum of money as compensation for their loss: **exactly £200**.\n\n**Why it supports the theme**\nThis example perfectly illustrates the theme because Mr. White got exactly what he asked for, but the cost was something he never would have agreed to pay. It serves as a warning that interfering with fate has unforeseen, tragic consequences. The money, which was supposed to secure their home and happiness, instead came at the price of their son's life, leaving the money useless to them in their grief."
