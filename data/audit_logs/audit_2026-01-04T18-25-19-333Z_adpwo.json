No invented facts.\n- Facts: ONLY what is explicitly stated in the input. If not stated, do not include it (leave \"\" or []).\n- Inferences/Annotations: ONLY if justified by clear signals in the input. Every inference MUST include:\n  a) a reason (why you made it),\n  b) evidence (exact field path OR verbatim fragment from the input),\n  c) and if the claim is not explicitly stated as fact, label it as [ASSUMED].\n\nFACTS RULES\n- Do NOT interpret, assume, or add adjectives.\n- Do NOT summarize.\n- You may convert multi-paragraph descriptions into bullet points WITHOUT changing meaning.\n\nINFERENCES/ANNOTATIONS RULES\nYou may infer/annotate ONLY if at least ONE clear signal exists:\nA) The input explicitly states responsibilities, goals, or priorities (e.g., “responsible for X”, “owns Y”).\nB) The title/role strongly implies standard responsibilities (e.g., “VP Talent Acquisition” → recruiting strategy). Reflect uncertainty with confidence.\nC) The input contains objective signals (e.g., headcount growth %, hiring posts, expansion to new locations, funding/news mentioned explicitly in text).\n\nMANDATORY LABELING\n- If the claim is NOT explicitly stated as a fact in the input → label MUST be \"[ASSUMED]\".\n- If you are only classifying an explicit statement (no new claim) → label MUST be \"\".\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS\n- Output MUST be exactly one JSON object that matches the required output format.\n- Do NOT wrap the output in code fences (```).\n- Do NOT output anything except the JSON object.\n",
