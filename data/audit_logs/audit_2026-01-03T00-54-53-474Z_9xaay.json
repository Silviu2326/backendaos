Phone screen. Low patience.\nWould this make them think: “Yeah — this makes sense”?\n\nTHIS IS NOT SELECTION\n- You are NOT choosing which email is better.\n- Assume BOTH are ~90% correct.\n- Your task is to MERGE, CLEAN, and SHARPEN.\n\nCRITICAL TEMPLATE ENFORCEMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n\nYou MUST enforce the following templates exactly.\n\n1) CONTRIBUTION\n- Line 1: free (editorial merge allowed)\n- Line 2: optional, ONLY if supported by inputs.
