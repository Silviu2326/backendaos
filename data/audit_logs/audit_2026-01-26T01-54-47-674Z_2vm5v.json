Phone screen. Low patience.\nWould this make them think: “Yeah — this makes sense”?\n\nTHIS IS NOT SELECTION\n- You are NOT choosing which email is better.\n- Assume BOTH are ~90% correct.\n- Your task is to MERGE, CLEAN, and SHARPEN.\n\nCRITICAL TEMPLATE ENFORCEMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n\nYou MUST enforce the following templates exactly.\n\n1) CONTRIBUTION\n- Line 1: free (editorial merge allowed)\n- Line 2: optional, ONLY if supported by inputs. If included, must be verbatim:\n  \"All of them interested in your offer beforehand.\"\n- Line 3: optional, ONLY if region/scope is defined and feasible. If included, must be verbatim:\n  \"And we can replicate this across the [entire opreating region]/[entire scope], at scale, automatically.\"\n\nYou may decide WHETHER to include optional lines.\nYou may NOT rewrite them.\n\n2) DETAILS\nIf included, DETAILS MUST be exactly:\n\n\"We can do this by:\n- Finding and qualifying [insert ICP] at scale\n- Automating Deep Research for every Lead to tailor each approach\n- Writing deeply personalized and relevant emails, designed to spark real interest\n- Managing all outbound campaigns end-to-end\n\nWe'll take care of the whole process, (company name) will just have to close all the new deals.\"\n\nOnly allowed substitutions:\n- (ICP)\n- (company name)\n\nNo edits, no paraphrasing, no omissions.\n\n3) CTA\nIf included, CTA MUST be exactly:\n\n\"If you like the idea, I’d love to show you more details over a quick 10-minute demo.\n\nThere, I’ll prepare a sample of 50 leads, all with tailored messages.\n\nThat way, you can see the quality of our results first.\n\nIf you’re open to it, let me know when it’s the best time for the demo.\n\"\n\nNo edits allowed.\n\nEDITORIAL FREEDOM (ONLY HERE)\nYou may editorially improve:\n- Subject line\n- Hook\n- Situation\n- Implication\n- Bridge\n- Contribution Line 1\n\nABSOLUTE RULES\n- Do NOT invent facts.\n- Do NOT add new promises.\n- Do NOT change angle or offer.\n- Do NOT add urgency or scarcity.\n- Do NOT alter templates.\n- Short, spoken sentences.\n- Remove fluff, repetition, and AI-ish phrasing.\n\nFINAL CHECK\nBefore finalizing, ask:\n“Would this email feel obvious, clean, and credible to the lead?”\n",
