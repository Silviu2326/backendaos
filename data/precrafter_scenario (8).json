        "outputData": "Creating a Python package involves transforming your code from a simple script into a structured format that can be installed via `pip` and shared with others (on PyPI).\n\nHere is the modern, standard guide to creating a Python package using **`pyproject.toml`** (the current best practice).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create the Directory Structure\n\nThe most robust way to organize a package is using the \"src layout.\" Create a folder for your project and set it up like this:\n\n```text\nmy_project/\n├── src/\n│   └── my_package_name/\n│       ├── __init__.py\n│       └── example_module.py\n├── pyproject.toml\n├── README.md\n└── LICENSE\n```\n\n*   **`my_project/`**: The root folder (holds everything).\n*   **`src/`**: A container for your actual code (prevents import errors during testing).\n*   **`my_package_name/`**: The actual name users will type to import your code (e.g., `import my_package_name`).\n*   **`__init__.py`**: Tells Python this folder is a package (can be empty).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Write Your Code\n\n**1. `src/my_package_name/example_module.py`**\nWrite a simple function to test.\n```python\ndef add_one(number):\n    return number + 1\n```\n\n**2. `src/my_package_name/__init__.py`**\nThis file exposes functions so users can import them easily.\n```python\nfrom .example_module import add_one\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Create the Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)\n\nIn the past, people used `setup.py`. Today, the standard is **`pyproject.toml`**. Create this file in your root folder:\n\n```toml\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"setuptools>=61.0\"]\nbuild-backend = \"setuptools.build_meta\"\n\n[project]\nname = \"my-unique-package-name\"\nversion = \"0.0.1\"\nauthors = [\n  { name=\"Your Name\", email=\"your.email@example.com\" },\n]\ndescription = \"A small example package\"\nreadme = \"README.md\"\nrequires-python = \">=3.7\"\nclassifiers = [\n    \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3\",\n    \"License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License\",\n    \"Operating System :: OS Independent\",\n]\n\n[project.urls]\n\"Homepage\" = \"https://github.com/yourusername/my_project\"\n```\n\n*   **Note:** The `name` under `[project]` must be unique if you plan to upload it to PyPI.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Create Supporting Files\n\n**1. `README.md`**\nThis is what appears on your PyPI page.\n```markdown\n# My Package\nThis is a simple example package.\n\n## Usage\n```python\nfrom my_package_name import add_one\nprint(add_one(2))\n```\n```\n\n**2. `LICENSE`**\nIf you want to share your package, you need a license. The **MIT License** is a common choice for open source. Copy the text from [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) into this file.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Build the Package\n\nYou need to generate the \"distribution\" files (archives) that `pip` installs.\n\n1.  Open your terminal/command prompt.\n2.  Install the build tool:\n    ```bash\n    pip install --upgrade build\n    ```\n3.  Run the build command from the root folder (`my_project/`):\n    ```bash\n    python -m build\n    ```\n\nYou will now see a new folder called **`dist/`** containing a `.whl` (wheel) file and a `.tar.gz` (source) file.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Install and Test Locally\n\nBefore sharing with the world, install it on your own machine to ensure it works.\n\n**Method A: Editable Install (Recommended for development)**\nThis allows you to edit code in `src` and see changes immediately without reinstalling.\n```bash\npip install -e .\n```\n\n**Method B: Install the built file**\n```bash\npip install dist/my_unique_package_name-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl\n```\n\n**Test it in Python:**\n```bash\npython\n>>> from my_package_name import add_one\n>>> add_one(5)\n6\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Publish to PyPI (Optional)\n\nTo let anyone in the world install your package using `pip install`, you upload it to the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n\n1.  **Create an account** on [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/).\n2.  **Install Twine** (the upload tool):\n    ```bash\n    pip install --upgrade twine\n    ```\n3.  **Upload:**\n    ```bash\n    python -m twine upload dist/*\n    ```\n    *You will be prompted for your API Token (create one in your PyPI account settings).*\n\n---\n\n### Summary Checklist\n1.  [ ] Code organized in `src/package_name`.\n2.  [ ] `__init__.py` created.\n3.  [ ] `pyproject.toml` configured.\n4.  [ ] `python -m build` ran successfully.\n5.  [ ] `pip install .` works locally."

        "output": "Creating a Python package involves transforming your code from a simple script into a structured format that can be installed via `pip` and shared with others (on PyPI).\n\nHere is the modern, standard guide to creating a Python package using **`pyproject.toml`** (the current best practice).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create the Directory Structure\n\nThe most robust way to organize a package is using the \"src layout.\" Create a folder for your project and set it up like this:\n\n```text\nmy_project/\n├── src/\n│   └── my_package_name/\n│       ├── __init__.py\n│       └── example_module.py\n├── pyproject.toml\n├── README.md\n└── LICENSE\n```\n\n*   **`my_project/`**: The root folder (holds everything).\n*   **`src/`**: A container for your actual code (prevents import errors during testing).\n*   **`my_package_name/`**: The actual name users will type to import your code (e.g., `import my_package_name`).\n*   **`__init__.py`**: Tells Python this folder is a package (can be empty).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Write Your Code\n\n**1. `src/my_package_name/example_module.py`**\nWrite a simple function to test.\n```python\ndef add_one(number):\n    return number + 1\n```\n\n**2. `src/my_package_name/__init__.py`**\nThis file exposes functions so users can import them easily.\n```python\nfrom .example_module import add_one\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Create the Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)\n\nIn the past, people used `setup.py`. Today, the standard is **`pyproject.toml`**. Create this file in your root folder:\n\n```toml\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"setuptools>=61.0\"]\nbuild-backend = \"setuptools.build_meta\"\n\n[project]\nname = \"my-unique-package-name\"\nversion = \"0.0.1\"\nauthors = [\n  { name=\"Your Name\", email=\"your.email@example.com\" },\n]\ndescription = \"A small example package\"\nreadme = \"README.md\"\nrequires-python = \">=3.7\"\nclassifiers = [\n    \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3\",\n    \"License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License\",\n    \"Operating System :: OS Independent\",\n]\n\n[project.urls]\n\"Homepage\" = \"https://github.com/yourusername/my_project\"\n```\n\n*   **Note:** The `name` under `[project]` must be unique if you plan to upload it to PyPI.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Create Supporting Files\n\n**1. `README.md`**\nThis is what appears on your PyPI page.\n```markdown\n# My Package\nThis is a simple example package.\n\n## Usage\n```python\nfrom my_package_name import add_one\nprint(add_one(2))\n```\n```\n\n**2. `LICENSE`**\nIf you want to share your package, you need a license. The **MIT License** is a common choice for open source. Copy the text from [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) into this file.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Build the Package\n\nYou need to generate the \"distribution\" files (archives) that `pip` installs.\n\n1.  Open your terminal/command prompt.\n2.  Install the build tool:\n    ```bash\n    pip install --upgrade build\n    ```\n3.  Run the build command from the root folder (`my_project/`):\n    ```bash\n    python -m build\n    ```\n\nYou will now see a new folder called **`dist/`** containing a `.whl` (wheel) file and a `.tar.gz` (source) file.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Install and Test Locally\n\nBefore sharing with the world, install it on your own machine to ensure it works.\n\n**Method A: Editable Install (Recommended for development)**\nThis allows you to edit code in `src` and see changes immediately without reinstalling.\n```bash\npip install -e .\n```\n\n**Method B: Install the built file**\n```bash\npip install dist/my_unique_package_name-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl\n```\n\n**Test it in Python:**\n```bash\npython\n>>> from my_package_name import add_one\n>>> add_one(5)\n6\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Publish to PyPI (Optional)\n\nTo let anyone in the world install your package using `pip install`, you upload it to the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n\n1.  **Create an account** on [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/).\n2.  **Install Twine** (the upload tool):\n    ```bash\n    pip install --upgrade twine\n    ```\n3.  **Upload:**\n    ```bash\n    python -m twine upload dist/*\n    ```\n    *You will be prompted for your API Token (create one in your PyPI account settings).*\n\n---\n\n### Summary Checklist\n1.  [ ] Code organized in `src/package_name`.\n2.  [ ] `__init__.py` created.\n3.  [ ] `pyproject.toml` configured.\n4.  [ ] `python -m build` ran successfully.\n5.  [ ] `pip install .` works locally."
