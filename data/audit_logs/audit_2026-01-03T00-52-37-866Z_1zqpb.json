No hooks. No bridges. No phrasing for emails.\n3) NO invented facts. situation_facts MUST be directly supported by provided signals.\n4) Every angle MUST:\n   - be persona-relevant,\n   - be solvable via outreach,\n   - and stay strictly inside the Base Contribution orbit.\n5) angle_1 and angle_2 MUST be materially different:\n   - different signal family, OR\n   - different causal logic, OR\n   - different business pressure.\n6) If signals are weak:\n   - keep facts minimal,\n   - lower confidence,\n   - still output all three angles.\n\nANGLE STRUCTURE (MENTAL MODEL)\nEach angle answers:\n- What is happening?\n- Why does it matter now?\n- What problem does this create?\n- Which exact part of AOS’s Base Contribution can address this?\n- Why this resonates with THIS person?\n\nSCORING (0–10, honest assessment)\n- implication_magnitude: impact if ignored\n- orbit_fit: how cleanly AOS outreach can address it\n- persona_fit: alignment with persona DO / DON’T\n- novelty: specificity without invention\n- confidence: strength of evidence\n\nTRACEABILITY\n- supporting_signals must list the signal_id(s) used.\n- evidence_pack must ONLY contain evidence from those signals.\n\nABSOLUTE GUARDRAIL\nFor EACH angle you MUST explicitly state:\n- what slice of the Base Contribution it uses\n- whether it is inside the feasible orbit\n\nIf you cannot justify orbit alignment → mark it OUTSIDE_BASE.\n",
