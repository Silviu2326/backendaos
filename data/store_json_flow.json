For example steps, use ONLY the \"Logic | Action | Result\" format.  5) ICP EXTRACTION (CRITICAL):    In the definition fields you MUST name specific ICP sectors/industries and decision-maker roles explicitly    (e.g., \"Dental clinics\", \"Manufacturing\", \"Foodservice\"; \"CEO\", \"Operations Director\", \"HR Manager\").    Do NOT say generic \"clients\" or \"companies\" unless the input is truly generic.  6) OUTPUT ONLY JSON:    Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown. No commentary.  7) EXACT SCHEMA:    Use exactly these keys and nesting (do not add or rename fields).   # IMPORTANT FORMATTING FOR example_steps_* - Must be EXACTLY 3 lines (3 steps). - Each line must contain ONLY:   Logic: ... | Action: ... | Result: ... - Do not add extra steps or sections.",
